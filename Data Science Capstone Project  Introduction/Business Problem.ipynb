Opening a bakery presents many unique challenges that are different from other types of businesses as there is high degree of competition.

Dataframe of neighborhoods in Kochi, India can be made by scraping the data from Wikipedia page using __BeautifulSoup__ library.\n\n### Methodology\n\nOnce the Dataframe of neighborhoods in Kochi, India is made by scraping the data from Wikipedia page using __BeautifulSoup__ library, the neighborhood addresses are converted into their equivalent latitude and longitude values using geocoder library. Using the lattitude & longitude coordinates, __Foursquare API__ is invoked to explore neighborhoods in Kochi, India.
